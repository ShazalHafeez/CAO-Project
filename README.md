# CAO-Project
It contains my progress in CAO(Computer Architecture &amp; Organization ) project. It detects authorized faces of user through ESP32 
The ultimate goal is to make a smart door bell which will detect a person's facve and decide whether to open the door automatically or send its picture to user and wait for response.
